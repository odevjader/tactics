### Descrição

Ensure there's a clear visual difference between player-controlled units and enemy units.

### Critérios de Aceitação

- [ ] Player units have a distinct color or shape compared to enemy units.
- [ ] The distinction is easily perceivable by the player.
- [ ] This is consistent with the requirements of TASK-003 (Unit Rendering).

### Arquivos Relevantes

* `js/main.js` (for verification)

### Relatório de Execução

Verified that a clear visual distinction between player and enemy units is already in place.
- In `js/main.js`, as part of TASK-003 (Unit Rendering), the following was implemented:
    - `PLAYER_COLOR` constant was defined (e.g., 'blue').
    - `ENEMY_COLOR` constant was defined (e.g., 'red').
    - Units in the `units` array are initialized with their respective `color` based on their `type`.
    - The `drawUnit(unit)` function uses `unit.color` when filling the rectangle representing the unit.
- This use of distinct colors (blue for player, red for enemies) provides an easily perceivable visual difference.
- No additional code changes were required for this task as the criteria were met by prior implementations.

This fulfills all acceptance criteria:
- Player units have a distinct color (blue) compared to enemy units (red).
- The distinction is easily perceivable.
- This is consistent with the requirements of TASK-003 (Unit Rendering).
