# Project Background and Design Notes for Tactics Saga

## Original MVP Rationale and Approach

(From end of original Section 1.0 of ROADMAP.md)
This highly focused approach for the MVP ensures that a core playable loop can be developed and tested rapidly in the browser.

(From original Section 2 - Phase 1 MVP of ROADMAP.md)
**Original MVP Goal:** Develop a functional and playable minimalist tactical combat demo in a web browser using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

**Original MVP Core Technologies Focus:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5 Canvas for rendering, basic HTML/CSS for structure.

**Original MVP Focus:** Core gameplay loop (Move -> Attack -> Enemy Response). Functionality and playability were paramount. Aesthetics were secondary for the MVP.

**Potential Risks Considered for MVP:**
- Canvas rendering performance for even simple scenes might be tricky if not optimized from the start (though unlikely for MVP scope).
- Implementing even simple grid logic (valid moves, adjacency) can be error-prone.
- Vanilla JS state management can become messy quickly; good structure is needed from the outset.
- Balancing the simple MVP (e.g., number of enemies, HP) to be engaging enough for a short demo.
- Time underestimation, even for a "simple" MVP.

## MVP Technology Stack Details

(From original Section 3 of ROADMAP.md)
For the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) / Demo, the goal was to create a simple, playable experience directly in a web browser. This dictated a lightweight and readily available technology stack.

### MVP Core Technologies Rationale
- **Language: JavaScript (JS)**
    - **Rationale (MVP):** JavaScript is the native language of web browsers, requiring no plugins or complex setup for users to play the game. It has a vast ecosystem of libraries and is well-suited for interactive web applications.
    - **Considerations (MVP):** We used modern JavaScript (ES6+) for better syntax and features. No complex frameworks (like React, Angular, Vue) were used for the initial MVP to keep things simple, focusing on vanilla JS for core logic.
- **Rendering: HTML5 Canvas API**
    - **Rationale (MVP):** The Canvas API provides a powerful 2D drawing surface directly in HTML. It's ideal for rendering grids, sprites (or simple shapes for the MVP), and game effects without external dependencies.
    - **Considerations (MVP):** We managed the game loop (update, draw) and handled all rendering logic (drawing grid lines, units, UI elements) directly using Canvas drawing commands.
- **Structure: HTML & CSS**
    - **Rationale (MVP):** Basic HTML structured the game page (containing the canvas element, any simple UI buttons, or text displays). CSS was used for minimal styling of these HTML elements.
    - **Considerations (MVP):** The focus was on functionality over elaborate design for the MVP.

### Art & Animation (MVP Simplification)
- **Initial Assets:** For the MVP, character and enemy representations were simple geometric shapes (colored squares/circles).
- **Animation:** Complex animations were avoided for the MVP. Movement was simple position updates, and attacks were indicated by a brief visual effect (a hit spark).

### Version Control (Note)
- **Git:** Remained essential. GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket for repository hosting.

### Project Management & Communication (MVP)
- **Tools:** For a solo developer MVP, project management was simpler (e.g., this Jules-Flow task system). Communication was internal.

### Development Approach for MVP
- **Focus:** Rapid prototyping of the core combat loop.
- **Modularity:** While keeping it simple, the JavaScript code was structured logically (e.g., separate functions for game state, rendering, unit logic) to allow for easier expansion post-MVP.
- **No External Libraries (Initially):** To maintain simplicity and control for the MVP, external game engines or complex utility libraries were avoided.

This streamlined stack allowed for quick iteration and focuses all effort on delivering a playable core experience in the browser for the MVP.

## Original Team Role Considerations (General Game Development Info)

(From original Section 4 of ROADMAP.md)
### MVP Development Team (Historical)
For the initial Browser-Based MVP, the development was undertaken by a single developer (Jules). This meant the roles of Game Designer, Programmer, and initial Artist (using placeholder graphics) and Tester were consolidated. The primary focus was on implementing the core technical features of the MVP.

The subsequent detailed roles (4.1 to 4.3) provide a broader view for potential team expansion post-MVP if the project were to grow.

### General Core Roles (Game Development)
- **Game Designer:**
    - **Responsibilities:** Defines the core gameplay mechanics, system design (combat, job system, economy), level design, narrative structure, and overall player experience. Works closely with all other roles to ensure the vision is cohesive. Responsible for documentation like the Game Design Document (GDD).
    - **Skills:** Strong understanding of game mechanics, creativity, analytical thinking, communication, documentation skills.
- **Programmer(s):**
    - **Responsibilities:** Writes the code that brings the game to life. Implements game logic, UI, AI, tools for the designers/artists, and ensures game performance and stability.
    - **Specializations (for larger teams or as needed):** Gameplay programmer, UI programmer, AI programmer, engine/systems programmer.
    - **Skills:** Proficiency in the chosen programming language and game engine, problem-solving, mathematics, logic.
- **Artist(s):**
    - **Responsibilities:** Creates all visual assets for the game. This includes character sprites/models, animations, environments, UI elements, item icons, and potentially concept art and marketing materials.
    - **Specializations:**
        - **Character Artist:** Designs and creates characters and their animations.
        - **Environment Artist:** Builds the game worlds, battlefields, and props.
        - **UI Artist:** Designs and implements the user interface and user experience (UI/UX).
        - **Pixel Artist:** Specializes in pixel art if that's the chosen aesthetic.
    - **Skills:** Drawing, digital painting, modeling (if 3D), animation, understanding of color theory, composition, and the chosen art style.
- **Writer/Narrative Designer:**
    - **Responsibilities:** Develops the game's story, writes dialogue, character backstories, lore, quest descriptions, and any in-game text. Ensures the narrative is engaging and integrates well with gameplay.
    - **Skills:** Creative writing, storytelling, dialogue crafting, understanding of narrative structure.

### General Supporting Roles (Game Development)
- **Sound Designer/Composer:**
    - **Responsibilities:** Creates or sources all audio elements: sound effects (SFX) for actions, UI feedback, ambient sounds, and composes the musical score.
    - **Skills:** Audio engineering, music composition, familiarity with audio software.
- **Quality Assurance (QA) Tester:**
    - **Responsibilities:** Plays the game extensively to find bugs, exploits, balance issues, and provide feedback on gameplay and user experience. This role is crucial for a polished final product.
    - **Skills:** Attention to detail, patience, communication, analytical skills. (Often, the whole team participates in QA).
- **Producer/Project Manager:**
    - **Responsibilities:** Oversees the project's development, manages timelines, budgets (if any), resources, and team communication. Ensures the project stays on track.
    - **Skills:** Organization, communication, leadership, problem-solving. (In small teams, this is often a lead designer or programmer).

### General Small Team Dynamics (Game Development)
- **Wearing Multiple Hats:** In a typical indie team of 2-4 people, roles will heavily overlap.
- **Core Needs:** Even for a very small team, you'll likely need: At least one strong Programmer, at least one versatile Artist, someone for Game Design and Writing.
- **Outsourcing/Assets:** Consider using pre-made assets for areas where the team lacks expertise or time.

Clear communication, a shared vision, and a passion for the project are essential for any team, regardless of size.
